# Plan for Phase 1

## Introduction
This is the starting phase for building Linova. This phase will mostly do the setup process with a little development to show the setup is working. PFB the plan outline,

## Plan Outline
- [ ] Setup Arduino IDE with nodemcu 8266. Document.
- [ ] Plan the pins of 8266 (which one to use for what purpose). Document.
- [ ] POC Basic code for LED ON-OFF. Document.
- [ ] POC basic code for Servo rotation. Document.
- [ ] POC basic code for connecting nodeMCU-8266 with WiFi. Document.
- [ ] POC basic code for communicating with Firebase. Document.
- [ ] Plan the commands structure and definitions between firebase and nodeMCU. Document.
- [ ] Create a physical robot head with cardboard or plastic
- [ ] Assemble robot neck with servo, for head movement
- [ ] Create robot eyes with LEDs
- [ ] Wireup everything
- [ ] Implement robot eyes ON-OFF with the commands sent from firebase
- [ ] Implement robot head rotation with the angle sent from firebase
