# LINOVA (Little Nova)
My attempt to build a (cute ?) little bot that can be controlled from mobile and respond to some basic commands may be? Don't know yet ...

I am planning to build it in phases. See **development phases** section below for a rough idea of the plans ahead

## Hardwares
See hardwares.md for phase wise hardware details

## Development Phases

### Phase 1

- Setup initial version of the server that will mediate between the *Mobile Controller* and the NodeMCU-8266 of Linova

- Setup initial version of the mobile controller

- Initial hardware setup

- **Final Goal :** With a rotate button on mobile-controller we should be able to rotate the head of Linova
